# An embedded screenshot of the app

# Technologies Used
## Express / React Native / Expo App / BreweryDB API / NPM React Native Elements

# A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
## I started working on Express and was able to finish it relatively quickly. The issues started with learning and setting up React Native. I used Expo on my iOS device to run the React Native front end and test it. A lot of the times the app would crash without giving an error message so I used console.log many times.

# Dependencies
## Expo app can be installed in the App Store
## Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:

npm install -g create-react-native-app
Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":

create-react-native-app AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start

This will start a development server for you, and print a QR code in your terminal.

# Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
## Major hurtles included React Native itself. Changing the tags wasn't an issue but it had multiple bugs that I had to get around by researching. Some issues were resolved with console.logs and heroku logs
